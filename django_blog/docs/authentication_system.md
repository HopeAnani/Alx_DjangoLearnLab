Introduction
The authentication system in the Django Blog project allows users to sign up, log in, log out, and manage their profiles. This system is built using Django's built-in tools for authentication, along with custom forms for user registration and profile management.

System Features
User Registration: Users can create an account with a username, email, and password.
Login and Logout: Users can log in with their credentials and log out when they’re done.
Profile Management: Once logged in, users can view and update their profile information like username and email.

Setup Instructions

Install Django First, you'll need to install Django. Open your terminal or command prompt and run this command:

pip install django
Create a Django Project and App

If you haven’t already, create a new Django project and app by running the following commands:

django-admin startproject myproject
python manage.py startapp blog
Add the App to Installed Apps

Open your settings.py file and add the blog app to the INSTALLED_APPS list:

INSTALLED_APPS = [
    'django.contrib.admin',
    'django.contrib.auth',
    'django.contrib.contenttypes',
    'django.contrib.sessions',
    'django.contrib.messages',
    'django.contrib.staticfiles',
    'blog',  # Add your app here
]


Create and Apply Migrations
Now, create the necessary database tables by running:

python manage.py makemigrations
python manage.py migrate
Add Authentication URLs
Don’t forget to include the authentication URLs in your urls.py file, so users can access the registration, login, and logout pages.

Run the Server
To get your project up and running, start the development server:

python manage.py runserver


You can now access the app at http://127.0.0.1:8000/ in your web browser.

Create a New Account
Visit http://127.0.0.1:8000/register/ to create a new user account.

User Guide

Registering an Account
Go to /register/ on your site.
Fill in the registration form with a username, email, and password.
After registering, you'll be sent to the login page to sign in.
Logging In
Visit /login/ and enter your username and password.
Once logged in, you’ll be redirected to either your profile or the home page.
Managing Your Profile
After logging in, go to /profile/ to see your current information.
You can update your username and email there, and any changes will be saved after you submit the form.
Logging Out
To log out, just visit /logout/ and you’ll be logged out of the site.

Security Considerations
CSRF Protection: Django uses the {% csrf_token %} tag to protect forms from Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) attacks. This ensures that only legitimate form submissions are accepted.
Password Hashing: Django automatically encrypts (hashes) passwords before storing them in the database. This keeps your passwords secure.
Login Required for Profile: The profile page is protected by Django’s @login_required decorator. This means only logged-in users can access their profile page.
